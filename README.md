# Current-Starved-VCO-SYNOPSYS-IITH-
This is a documentation of the steps involved in designing a VCO on the SYNOPSYS Custom Compiler on the 28nm SDK
### About

Following the [4:16 bottom up decoder](https://github.com/virginrobotics/bottomupdecoder_esim_ngspice), I got the oppurtunity through VSD again to compete in the Analog IC Design Hackathon SYNOPSYS IITH , where it was a logical step to design an analog circuit , hence the VCO. VCOs Voltage Controlled Oscillator find applications in most clocked computer systems,
